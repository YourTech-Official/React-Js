Q1. What is difference between library and framework ?
Ans - A library is a collection of reusable code for specific tasks,
 which your code calls and controls, giving you control over the application flow.
 A framework provides a structured, pre-defined architecture and dictates the overall application flow.

 Library:

Collection of functions you call when needed. You control the application flow.

Example: React, jQuery

Framework:

Complete structure that controls your app. It calls your code at specific points.

Example: Angular, Django

Q2. What is the difference between JavaScript and JavaScript + SWC( Speedy Web Compiler) ?
Ans - JavaScript: Regular JS code that runs directly.

JavaScript + SWC: JS code that gets compiled first for better performance and compatibility.

Simple difference:

JS = Write and run

JS + SWC = Write, compile (super fast), then run.(SWC written in Rust.)

Understand folder structure : -

package.json - Contains project info, scripts, and dependencies list

dependencies - Packages needed for production (runtime)

devDependencies - Packages needed only for development (build tools, testing)

src/ - Source code folder (your main code)

public/ - Static files (HTML, images, icons)

node_modules/ - Downloaded packages (don't touch)

build/ - Compiled/production ready code

.gitignore - Files to ignore in version control

eslint.config.js - Code quality rules and error checking configuration

README.md - Project documentation and instructions

vite.config.js - Vite build tool configuration and settings

package-lock.json - Locks exact versions of all dependencies for consistent installs

Q3. What is Component in react or in general term ? 
Ans - A component is a reusable piece of code that returns UI elements.
 It's like a custom HTML tag that you can use multiple times.

General term: Independent, reusable building blocks
React term: JavaScript function that returns JSX

Example: Button, Header, Card components

Benefits: Reusable, maintainable, organized code

Q4. What difference between components and function ?
Ans - Component is a special function that returns JSX/UI elements. Regular function performs tasks and returns data.

Function: Does calculations, processes data
Component: Returns UI elements (JSX)

Example:
Function: add(a, b) returns number
Component: App() returns <div>Hello</div>
